# Kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

 * The Purpose of this analysis was to refractor the code to see if the refractor code would compile the data faster than the original VBA code. this would tell us if the code is more efficient then the original.  



### Results
	* unfortunately, my refractor code was not able to accomplish the desired outcomes necessary to do the analysis, i could not successfully refractor the code changes in the desired way in order to do the comparison between 2017 and 2018 conposition times

	* however from the data, we can see that the  year 2017 was a year that havd much better returns than in 2018. as the code estimated the returns by calculating the ending price of the ticker and starting price of the same ticker, this showed that 2017 was a more profitable year for the stocks chosen.

### Summary
	*  	The advantages to refactoring code is to get the code to run more smoothly and faster, which is important when dealing with large amounts of data
		however the disadvantages are that you may get it to run slower, or in the attempt to refractor the code, you find code that doesnt work properly as i did when trying to refractor.
